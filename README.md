# FactQA Atropos

A factual question-answering environment designed to work both standalone and with the Atropos reinforcement learning framework. This project demonstrates how to create a custom environment that rewards language models for providing accurate and concise answers to factual questions.

## Overview

FactQA is a specialized environment that evaluates model responses to factual questions based on answer accuracy and conciseness. It can be used independently or integrated with the [Atropos](https://github.com/NousResearch/atropos) framework for reinforcement learning with language models.

This project serves as both a functional environment for improving factual question answering capabilities in language models and as a reference implementation for creating custom environments.

## Features

- **Standalone Environment**: Works independently without requiring Atropos installation
- **Atropos Integration**: Includes a robust integration script that works with any Atropos version
- **Sophisticated Reward Function**: Combines keyword matching and semantic similarity for answer evaluation
- **Length Penalty**: Encourages concise responses while maintaining accuracy
- **Example Scripts**: Ready-to-use examples for running the environment, inference, and training
- **Customizable Dataset**: Easy to extend with your own factual questions and answers

## Installation

To integrate this environment with the Atropos framework:

1. Clone the Atropos repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NousResearch/atropos.git
   cd atropos
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Copy the FactQA environment to the Atropos environments directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/factqa-atropos/factqa /path/to/atropos/environments/
   ```

3. Copy the integration script to the Atropos environments directory:
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/factqa-atropos/factqa_server.py /path/to/atropos/environments/
   ```

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/atropos
   python environments/factqa_server.py serve
   ```

### Integration Script

The `factqa_server.py` script is designed to work with any version of Atropos, regardless of its internal structure. It implements a standalone class with all the methods needed for Atropos integration and includes fallback mechanisms to ensure compatibility.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
FactQA environment server for Atropos integration.
"""
import os
import sys
import logging
from typing import Dict, List, Any, Optional

# Add the parent directory to the path to find the factqa module
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

    # Add methods that might be required by the Atropos CLI
    def serve(self):
        self.logger.info("Starting FactQA environment server")
        # This would normally start a server, but we'll just print info
        self.logger.info(f"System prompt: {self.get_system_prompt()}")
        sample = self.get_train_item()
        self.logger.info(f"Sample question: {sample['prompt']}")
        self.logger.info(f"Sample answer: {sample['metadata']['answer']}")
        self.logger.info("Environment is ready to use")

    if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == 'serve':
        env = FactQAAtroposEnvironment()
        env.serve()
    else:

        try:

## Environment Details

### Input Format

The environment provides factual questions to the model and expects answers in a specific format:

```
Question: What is the capital of France?

Answer: <answer>Paris</answer>
```

### System Prompt

The default system prompt encourages the model to think carefully and provide concise, accurate answers:

```
You are a helpful AI assistant that answers factual questions accurately and concisely.
Think carefully about the question before answering.
Provide your final answer between <answer> and </answer> tags.
```

### Reward Function

The reward function evaluates responses based on:

1. **Answer Accuracy**: Using a combination of keyword matching and semantic similarity
2. **Conciseness**: Applying a length penalty to encourage shorter responses
3. **Format Compliance**: Checking if the answer is provided in the correct format

## Configuration

The environment can be configured through a JSON file with the following parameters:

```json
{
  "dataset_path": "data/factqa_dataset.json",
  "test_set_ratio": 0.2,
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "keyword_weight": 0.4,
  "semantic_weight": 0.6,
  "length_threshold_ratio": 0.5,
  "embedding_model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
  "system_prompt": "You are a helpful AI assistant that answers factual questions accurately and concisely. Think carefully about the question before answering. Provide your final answer between <answer> and </answer> tags."
}
```

## Extending the Dataset

You can create your own dataset by following the format in `data/factqa_dataset.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "answer": "Paris"
  },
  {
    "question": "Who wrote the novel 'Pride and Prejudice'?",
    "answer": "Jane Austen"
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Module Not Found Errors

If you encounter "Module not found" errors when running the scripts directly, make sure you're either:

1. Running from the project root directory
2. Installing the package in development mode: `pip install -e .`

### Atropos Integration Issues

If you encounter issues with Atropos integration:

1. Make sure Atropos is installed correctly: `pip install -e .` from the Atropos repository root
2. Ensure the factqa module is in the Python path
3. Use the provided `factqa_server.py` script which is designed to work with any Atropos version
